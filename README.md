# Vue-Read-Time
Vue Read Time is a plugin I made because I was inspired by Medium.org's read time, shown in the title of posts.
In addition, I made this as an effort to learn Vue.

# Installing the Plugin:
1. Import the plugin, then:
2. Install it: `Vue.use(ReadTime);`
3. Done!

# Usage

In your components, you can call:
* `this.$getReadTimeInSeconds`
* `this.$getReadTimeInMinutes`
* `this.$getReadTimeInSecondsString`
* `this.$getReadTimeInMinutesString`
* `this.$getReadTimeString`
* `getReadTimeStringAlternate`
